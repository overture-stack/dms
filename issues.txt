- ego ui doesn't support path url (assumes root)
    - workaround is to expose ui in local mode on a specific port, won't work on prod
- song swagger doesn't work properly behind proxy
    - can be fixed in song quickly
- dms (non docker) cannot provision buckets since the reverse proxy rewrite the host which invalidates the presigned url signature
  rewriting the host is needed for urls generated from score
  - workaround had to connect dms on localhost port for minio
- minio ui doesn't work on the reverse proxy /minio-server (redirects issue)
    - only works on the minio port forwarded.
